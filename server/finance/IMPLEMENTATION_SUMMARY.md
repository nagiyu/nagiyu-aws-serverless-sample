# EventBridge Implementation Summary

## Issue #41: バッタによるプッシュ通知の修正

### Requirements Implemented ✅

1. **Changed from Web request to EventBridge trigger**
   - Modified `server/finance/index.ts` to use `EventBridgeEvent` instead of `APIGatewayEvent`
   - Function now responds to CloudWatch Events (EventBridge) scheduled triggers

2. **10-minute runtime with 1-minute checks**
   - Implemented loop that runs for 10 minutes (600 seconds)
   - Checks stock prices every minute (60 seconds)
   - Proper timing logic with remaining time checks

3. **User notification data retrieval**
   - Uses `FinanceNotificationService` to get all user notification configurations
   - Processes each notification setting individually

4. **Enhanced stock price retrieval**
   - Created server-side Exchange and Ticker services
   - Added proper ID-to-key lookup for stock symbols
   - Uses actual exchange and ticker keys for TradingView API calls

5. **Conditional push notifications**
   - Checks if current price meets user-defined conditions (greater than/less than)
   - Sends push notifications only when conditions are satisfied
   - Enhanced notification messages with stock names and symbols

### Files Created/Modified

#### New Server-Side Services and Interfaces:
- `finance/interfaces/data/ExchangeDataType.ts`
- `finance/interfaces/data/TickerDataType.ts`
- `finance/interfaces/record/ExchangeRecordType.ts`
- `finance/interfaces/record/TickerRecordType.ts`
- `finance/services/ExchangeDataAccessor.ts`
- `finance/services/ExchangeService.ts`
- `finance/services/TickerDataAccessor.ts`
- `finance/services/TickerService.ts`

#### Modified Files:
- `server/finance/index.ts` - Complete rewrite for EventBridge trigger
- `finance/utils/FinanceUtil.ts` - Added `getCurrentStockPrice()` method

#### Test Files:
- `server/finance/test-eventbridge.js` - EventBridge trigger test
- `server/finance/test-financeutil.js` - FinanceUtil unit test structure

### Key Improvements

1. **Proper Symbol Resolution**: No longer uses database IDs directly for stock API calls
2. **Enhanced Logging**: Better error handling and debugging information
3. **Scalable Architecture**: Created reusable services for Exchange and Ticker data
4. **User-Friendly Messages**: Push notifications include stock names and clear information

### Testing

The implementation has been verified with:
- ✅ TypeScript compilation without errors
- ✅ EventBridge event structure validation
- ✅ Service architecture validation
- ✅ Expected behavior in test environment

### Technical Architecture

```
EventBridge (10-minute schedule)
  ↓
Lambda Handler (runs for 10 minutes)
  ↓
Every minute:
  1. Get all FinanceNotification records
  2. For each notification:
     - Lookup Exchange by ID → get exchange.key
     - Lookup Ticker by ID → get ticker.key
     - Call TradingView API with exchange.key:ticker.key
     - Check if price meets user condition
     - Send push notification if condition met
```

This implementation fully satisfies the requirements specified in issue #41.
